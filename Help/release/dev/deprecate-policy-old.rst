deprecate-policy-old
--------------------

* An explicit deprecation diagnostic was added for policies ``CMP0037``
  through ``CMP0054`` (``CMP0036`` and below were already deprecated).
  The :manual:`cmake-policies(7)` manual explains that the OLD behaviors
  of all policies are deprecated and that projects should port to the
  NEW behaviors.
